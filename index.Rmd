Harris County, which includes Houston, has received more than $3 billion in flood losses from the Federal Emergency Management Agency since 1976. It ranks third behind Orleans and Jefferson counties in Lousiana, which sustained significant damage during Hurricane Katrina. 

The county also ranks third for total losses with more than 100,000 total losses recordedâ€” almost double the fourth-ranking Miami-Dade County.

As a city, Houston has received about $1.6 billion in flood mitigation assistance. The fourth-largest amount in the country.

From FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program [data page](https://www.fema.gov/policy-claim-statistics-flood-insurance). From 1978 to March 2017.
